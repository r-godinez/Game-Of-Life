# Conway's Game of Life - Python Implementation

## Overview

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It simulates the evolution of cells based on a set of rules applied to a grid of cells, where each cell can either be alive or dead.

This program implements Conway's Game of Life using Python and Pygame, providing a simple graphical interface to visualize the simulation.

## Features

- Press `Enter` to start the game.
- Press the `Space Bar` to stop the game.
- Press the `R` key to create a random initial state.
- Press the `F` key to increase the simulation speed.
- Press the `S` key to decrease the simulation speed.
- Press the `C` key to clear screen.
- The game must be stopped to input commands.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need to have Python and Pygame installed. 

### Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from the official Python website: [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Pygame

You can install Pygame using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame
```
